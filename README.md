## General info
In this project, our goal is to break apart the Smashing magazine website. This is to start training ourselves to think in terms of visual hierarchy, typography and design principles.
The purpose is to create a grayscale heat map of the <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine website</a> that indicates which elements have the greatest weight in the visual hierarchy. It is a collaborative effort by <a href="https://github.com/adaorachi">MaryAnn Chukwuka</a> and <a href="https://github.com/JayKowski"> Judah Maina </a>.
